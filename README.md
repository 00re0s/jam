## About

**Jam** is a modular man-in-the-middle proxy for Animal Jam.

## Note

The latest Animal Jam patch requires you to disable "secure mode" (top-tier security no ðŸ§¢) within the client. If you are unable to do so, Jam has included the latest client with the mode already disabled.

Due to this, you must now use [Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) or something simular to re-route the client to your edited client version.

I will **not** help you setup Fiddler, you're on your own from here.

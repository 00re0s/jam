## About

I developed this project during **2018** in order of understanding how the Animal Jam backend application works, with the ability to inject commands and packets.
The injector works by performing a MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) attack between the client application and the server and is inspecting the commands and responses that are exchanged between them.

## Caveat

To utilise the injector, its required to trick the application into connecting to the injector instead of the remote server. Then the injector will complete the connection.
